## First DNA/RNA extractions

Extractions from each of the three coral species for the 5E project. One vial from each of the study species were used.

#### Extraction Date: August 24, 2021 
**Samples**

|Tube_no|Timepoint|Species|Colony ID|Tube ID|Site|
|1|January|*Porites*|POR-266|202000103|2|
|31|January|*Acropora*|ACR-267|202000103|2|
|59|January|*Pocillopora*|POC-255|202000103|2|

**Extraction notes**
 - Half to a third of coral fragment clipped and 500 Î¼l of DNA/RNA shield from sample tube placed in tube with 2 mL 0.5 mm glass beads and 500ul of RNA/DNA shield
 - *Pocillopora* and *Acropora* were bead beated for one minute while *Porites* was bead beated for two
 - After bead beating the samples, I briefly centrifuged them down to help get the debris to the bottom of the tube and help get rid of some of the foam
 - Pulled 300ul of this out and added it to a new 1.5ml tube and used it for the extraction. The volume remaining was placed back into the -80C
 - 300ul of tissue homogenate, 15ul of ProK, and 30ul of ProK digestion buffer
 - Then followed the protocol as described in [protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md)


**Qubit**
 - Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
 - All samples read twice, standard only read once
 
**DNA**

|Tube_no|RFU|DNA 1 (ng/ul)| DNA 2 (ug/ul)| Average|
|Standard 1|193.51||||
|Standard 2|21113.81|||
|1||6.56|6.24|6.4|
|31||9.04|8.78|8.91|
|59||4.22|4.00|4.11|

**RNA**

|Tube_no|RFU||RNA 1 (ng/ul)| RNA 2 (ug/ul)| Average|
|Standard 1|360.21||||
|Standard 2|6868.73||||
|1||too low|too low|too low|
|31|11.2|11.2|11.2|
|59|24.0|22.8|23.4|

**Tape Station**
 - Used to check RNA quality [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)
 - I did not tape station the first sample because there was no detectable RNA

**Gel**
Modified from [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)
 - Added 0.75g of agarose and 50ml of 1x TAE to flask and microwaved for 45 seconds. This makes a 1.5% gel
 - Once cool enough to touch added 2ul of gel red stain
 - Swirled and poured into gel mould with comb
 - Once solidified, covered with 1X TAE as a running buffer
 - Added 1ul of purple loading dye to each of my QC strip tube samples. I had ~9ul of DNA leftover from QC and ~3ul of RNA
 - Loaded my gel with the DNA first, then skipped a well and then the RNA
 - Ran the gel for 60 minutes at 60 volts
