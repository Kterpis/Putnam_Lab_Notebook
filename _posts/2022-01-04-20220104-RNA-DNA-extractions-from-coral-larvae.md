## DNA/RNA extractions from coral larvae

Extractions from the coral larvae to be used for TaqSeq

---

#### Extraction Date: December 30, 2021 


**Extraction notes**
 - Each tube contained 50 Pocillopora acuta larvae that were flash frozen in LN2
 - Added 700ul of RNA/DNA shield to each tube
 - The entire volume of that sample was added to a bead tube containing 0.5mm glass beads and vortexed on max speed for 30 seconds
 - The tubes were briefly spun down to help remove the foam
 - Pulled out 300ul from the bead tubes and added to new 1.5ml tubes. The bead tubes were placed into the -80C freezer 
 - Spun down samples for 3 minutes at 9000 rcf and then transfer the supernatant to new tube without disturbing the pellet
 - 300ul of shield, 15ul of ProK, and 30ul of ProK digestion buffer, let sit for 2 minutes
 - All spins were done for 1 minute or 2.30 minutes
 - Did two washes with 700ul of wash buffer for both the DNA and RNA
 - Then followed the protocol as described in [protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md)


**Qubit**
 - Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
 - All samples read twice, standards only read once

**Tape Station**
 - Tape station broke! 

**Gel**
 - Modified from this [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)
 - Added 0.75g of agarose and 50ml of 1x TAE to flask and microwaved for 45 seconds. This makes a 1.5% gel
 - Once cool enough to touch added 1ul of gel green stain
 - Swirled and poured into gel mould with comb
 - Once solidified, covered with 1X TAE as a running buffer
 - Added 1ul of purple loading dye to each of my QC strip tube samples. I had ~9ul of DNA leftover from QC and ~8ul of RNA
 - Made 2 gels, one for the DNA, one for the RNA
 - Ran the gel for 50 minutes at 60 volts, the RNA gel could have used another 10 minutes to get better seperation between the bands

 **Addtional Notes**
  - 21 samples at once is way too many samples.
