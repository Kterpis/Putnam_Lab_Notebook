**Extraction notes**
 - ACR and POC samples: pulled out 300ul of shield
 - POR samples: pulled out 150ul and then added 150ul of new shield. The thought behind this was to try and limit the amount of inhibitor 
 - Spun down samples for 3 minutes at 9000 rcf and then transfer the supernatant to new tube without disturbing the pellet
 - 300ul of shield, 15ul of ProK, and 30ul of ProK digestion buffer, let sit for 2 minutes
 - All spins were done for 1 minute or 2.30 minutes
 - Did two washes with 700ul of wash buffer for both the DNA and RNA
 - Then followed the protocol as described in [protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md)


**Qubit**
 - Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
 - All samples read twice, standard only read once

**Tape Station**
 - Used to check RNA quality [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)
 - I did not tape station 415, and 775 because there was no detectable RNA 
 - [Results Link](https://github.com/Kterpis/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/2089bee171ecbaf22baf992b3351dcbe155e6b77/images/tape_station/2021-09-02%20-%2015.07.36.pdf)

**Gel**
 - Modified from this [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)
 - Added 0.75g of agarose and 50ml of 1x TAE to flask and microwaved for 45 seconds. This makes a 1.5% gel
 - Once cool enough to touch added 2ul of gel red stain
 - Swirled and poured into gel mould with comb
 - Once solidified, covered with 1X TAE as a running buffer
 - Added 1ul of purple loading dye to each of my QC strip tube samples. I had ~9ul of DNA leftover from QC and ~8ul of RNA
 - Loaded my gel with the DNA first, then skipped a well and then the RNA
 - Ran the gel for 60 minutes at 60 volts

 **Addtional Notes**
  - 711 had some pigment after the elution steps
